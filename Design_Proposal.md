# Design Proposal

* A pressure sensing mat to measure the effectiveness of the seat as well as forces on the driver. This mat could be used to compile a pressure map.

## Bill of Materials

* List of all materials that will be used here, their purpose, cost, quantity, etc
* 40- 50kg Load cells
* https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Weight-Resistance-Half-Bridge-Weighing/dp/B09KGSGL18/ref=pd_ybh_a_sccl_14/133-4782788-9217400?pd_rd_w=5DN1d&content-id=amzn1.sym.67f8cf21-ade4-4299-b433-69e404eeecf1&pf_rd_p=67f8cf21-ade4-4299-b433-69e404eeecf1&pf_rd_r=BQV5H4PXN8RD8DM16Z6T&pd_rd_wg=lEW2F&pd_rd_r=53050ffa-95d3-4d56-b05b-a3656b353ab0&pd_rd_i=B09KGSGL18&psc=1

* 2 yards of canvas/burlap

* instrumentation amp from maker space?
* multiplexer?
* 

## Electrical Design

* Information here about the electrical design, starting from the output of the load cell and ending at the Arduino data logging (0-100% of each load cell?)
*load cell to op amp to multiplexer

## Physical Seat Setup

* Driver on top
* ~1" seat padding on top of semi-firm sheet
* Top layer of "sandwich" is cloth covering
* sensors are glued on to fabric then stictched btwn layers (possible 1/8-1/4in foam to spread the load)
* Bottom layer of "sandwich" is another cloth piece 
* Bottom layer is hard vehicle seat itself
*
*3 sensors on either bolster
*5x5 matrix for butt
*2x3 matrix for back 

* can tie the sheet to mount points for seatbelt to have a semi-standard fit
