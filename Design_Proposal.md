# Design Proposal

* Short description about how this device will function

## Bill of Materials

* List of all materials that will be used here, their purpose, cost, quantity, etc

## Electrical Design

* Information here about the electrical design, starting from the output of the load cell and ending at the Arduino data logging (0-100% of each load cell?)

## Physical Seat Setup

* Driver on top
* ~1" seat padding on top of semi-firm sheet
* Top layer of "sandwich" is cloth covering
* Middle layer of "sandwich" is a thin piece of padding foam to keep sensors in place
* Bottom layer of "sandwich" is another cloth piece
